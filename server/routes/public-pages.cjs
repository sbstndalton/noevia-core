const ABOUT = page('About', `<h1>noevia</h1>
<p>noevia is a private, self-hosted workspace for chat, projects and a personal diary. It runs on its owner's own server and uses AI models that run on that server.</p>
<h2>Google Drive backups</h2>
<p>An administrator can connect Google Drive so that noevia's nightly backups also keep a copy off the server. Backups are encrypted on the server before upload; Google only ever stores scrambled files in a folder called <code>noevia-offsite</code>.</p>`);

const PRIVACY = page('Privacy policy', `<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
<p>Last updated 18 September 2026.</p>
<h2>Who runs this</h2>
<p>This noevia server is run privately by its owner for themselves and people they invite. It is not a commercial service.</p>
<h2>What noevia stores</h2>
<p>Accounts, chats, projects, settings and diary entries are stored on this server only. Nothing is sold or shared with third parties, and nothing is used for advertising.</p>
<h2>Google user data</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is accessed:</strong> with the <code>drive.file</code> permission, noevia can see and manage only the files it creates itself in your Google Drive (the <code>noevia-offsite</code> backup folder). It cannot see any other file in your Drive. It also reads your Google account email address, only to show which account is connected.</li>
<li><strong>How it is used:</strong> solely to upload, list and remove noevia's own encrypted backup files. Backups are encrypted with AES-256-GCM on the server before upload, so their contents are unreadable to Google.</li>
<li><strong>Storage and protection:</strong> the Google sign-in token is stored encrypted on this server and is never sent to any browser or third party.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong> Google user data is not shared, sold, transferred or used for any other purpose, and is not used to train AI models.</li>
<li><strong>Removal:</strong> Disconnect in Settings → Backups revokes noevia's access at Google and deletes the stored token. You can also remove access at <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions">myaccount.google.com/permissions</a>. Backup files in your Drive stay yours to delete.</li>
</ul>
<p>noevia's use of information received from Google APIs adheres to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>
